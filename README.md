# Hook-Browser-UWP-Extension-Manager-Sample
An example app that demonstrates how to manage and use extensions. This example shows how you can use code in your extensions too. 
Based on the App Extensibility Sample from Build 2016: https://github.com/Microsoft/App-Extensibility-Sample
Here is the session from Build 2016: https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2016/B808

Feel free to fork it and customise the sample to your needs

Here is an extension that currently works with the sample: https://github.com/colinkiama/Hook-Browser-Theme-Colour-Extension

I also recommend looking at the App Services Documentation: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/launch-resume/how-to-create-and-consume-an-app-service

Requires Windows 10 Anniversary Update SDK (14393) or higher
